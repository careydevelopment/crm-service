# CRM Service

This is a Spring Boot application that's used with the "Building a CRM Application " series on the <a href="https://careydevelopment.us" target="_blank">Carey Development website</a>.

It's a microservice that handles requests related to CRM-specific objects within an ecosystem.

Each branch within this repo is related to a distinct guide. The master branch holds the latest version of the application.

If you want to follow along with the series, just visit the URL that points to the <a href="https://careydevelopment.us/tag/careydevelopmentcrm" target="_blank">careydevelopmentcrm tag</a>. 

Remember, all guides are in reverse chronological order so if you want to start from the beginning, you'll need to go to the last page.

## You Need to Make Updates
Bad news: you can't just clone this source and run it right out of the box. You'll need to make some changes.

Some info, like the JWT secret and the MongoDB connection string, are located in a separate properties file stored outside of the source repo. That's so I don't accidentally check in secure info.

The locations of the external properties files are specified in the `application.properties` file. Look for the `ecosystem.properties.file.location` and the `crm.properties.file.location` properties.

## Configuration
Although some of the configuration options are located in application.properties, not all of them are there.

Some info, like the JWT secret and the MongoDB connection string, are located in a separate properties file stored outside of the source repo. That's
so I don't accidentally check in secure info.

The locations of the external properties files are specified in the `application.properties` file. Look for the `ecosystem.properties.file.location` and the `crm.properties.file.location` properties.

Here's a list of the properties in that `ecosystem.properties` file:
* `jwt.secret` - the secret used to sign JWTs
* `mongodb.carey-ecosystem.connection` - the connection string to get to the MongoDB (in the format: mongodb://name:password@server:port)
* `ecosystem-user-service.endpoint` - the base URL to <a href="https://github.com/careydevelopment/ecosystem-user-service">the user service</a>
* `customer-service.endpoint` - the base URL to <a href="https://github.com/careydevelopment/ecosystem-customer-service">the customer service.</a>
* `geo-service.endpoint` - the base URL to state and country lookups (currently private repo).
* `product-service.endpoint` - the base URL to <a href="https://github.com/careydevelopment/ecosystem-product-service">the product service.</a>
* `crm-service.endpoint` - the base URL to <a href="https://github.com/careydevelopment/crm-service">the CRM service.</a> 

The `crm.properties` file simply contains a URL to the MongoDB:
* `mongodb.crm.connection=mongodb://user:password@mycoolhost.com:1100`

## Dependencies

This service uses <a href="https://github.com/careydevelopment/ecosystem-user-service">ecoystem-user-service</a> to get user information. You'll
need to deploy that service if you want to persist CRM-related details. 

## The UI
The Carey Development CRM <a href="https://github.com/careydevelopment/careydevelopmentcrm">source</a> uses this service.
